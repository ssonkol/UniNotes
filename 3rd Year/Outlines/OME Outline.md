Bellman-Ford - 
- Theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PHkk0UavIM&ab_channel=MichaelSambol
- Example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obWXjtg0L64 

Works on graphs with negative edge weights but fails with negative cycles - this is a non-greedy algorithm

V or more edges in a path means that there is a repeated vertex therefore a cycle

- Don't forget you need to add previous node with current edge weight to get new vertex distance
Doesn't work with negative edge weights or negative cycles - this is because it is a greedy algorithm
