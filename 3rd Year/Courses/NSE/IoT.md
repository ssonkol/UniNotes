### IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN overview
IEEE 802 is a committee that has developed standards for a wide range of local area networks 

In 1990 the IEEE 802 Committee formed a new working group, IEEE 802.11, with a charter to develop a protocol and transmission specifications for wireless LANs

Since that time, the demand for WLANs at different frequencies and data rates has exploded.

### Wi-Fi Alliance
The first 802.11 standard to gain broad industry acceptance was 802.11b

Wireless ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA)
- An industry consortium formed in 1999
- Subsequently renamed the Wi-Fi Alliance
- Created a test suite to certify interoperability for 802.11 products

Wi-Fi
- The term used for certified 802.11b products
- Has been extended to 802.11g products

Wi-Fi5
- A certification process for 802.11a products that was a developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance

Recently the Wi-Fi Alliance has developed certification procedures for IEEE 802.11 security standards
- Referred to as Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)

### IEEE 802.11 security 
There is an increased need for robust security services and mechanisms for wireless LAN

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
- The privacy portion of the 802.11 standard
- Content major weaknesses

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
- A set of security mechanisms that eliminates most 802.11 security issues
- Based on the current state of 802.11i standard

Robust Security Network (RSN)
- Final form of 802.11i standard
- Complex

#### Group Keys
Group keys are used for multicast communication in which one STA sends MPDUs (Media access control protocol data units) to multiple STAs

Group Maser Key (GMK)
- Key-generating key used with other inputs to derive GTK

Group Temporal Key (GTK)
- Generated by the AP and transmitted to its associated STAs
- IEEE 802.11i requires that its value is computationally indistinguishable from random
- Distributed securely using the pairwise keys that are already established
- Is changed every time a device leaves a network

### IoT
Things - Any physical objects that have the ability of sensing the environment and transmitting the sensed data to the internet and receiving data from the internet. So the "things" are smart.

Four Classes of "things":
- Class A: Tag
	- No processing capability
	- No signal transmitting capability
	- May depends on external readers that uses radio frequencies to automatically identify and track them as tags attached to objects
	- Example: RFID barcodes, magnetic stripe
- Class B: Single purpose
	- May have some processing capability
	- Maybe have an operating system
	- Ability to communicate wiht other objects using agreed protocols
	- Examples: Heat sensors, smart watches, personal health devices
- Class C: Integrated
	- May have some processing integrated with devices that have other core functionalities
	- Customised operating system
	- Processing capability
	- Examples: Robots in plants, industrial automation devices, connected vehicles, medical equipment
- Class D: High End
	- Similar to Class C devices, and with additional requirement
	- Rugged
	- Highly secure
	- Highly reliable
	- Examples: Military and high-end medical devices

#### Architectures of IoT
![[Pasted image 20230508143935.png]]

Object layer:
- Also called the perceptron layer
- Representing the physical sensors and actuators
- Querying data on location, temperature, weight, vibration, acceleration, humidity, etc.
- Generating the big data of IoT

Object abstraction layer
- Transfer data from the lower layer (the object layer) to the upper layer (the Service Management Layer) via secure channels
- Use technologies such as RFID, Cellular systems (3G/4G/5G, GSM, UMTS), WiFi, Bluetooth, Infrared, ZigBee
- Include cloud computing and data management processes

Service Management Layer:
- This layer is also called middleware (pairing) layer - it pairs a service with its requester based on addresses and names
- Enables the IoT application programmers to work with heterogeneous objects without consideration to a specific hardware platform

Application layer
- Various applications we already mentioned
- Smart Vehicles, smart school, smart market, smart Industry, smart transportation, smart healthcare, smart agriculture, smart home, smart building, etc.

Business layer
- Manage the overall IoT system activities and services
- Build a business model, graphs, flowcharts, etc. based on the received data from the Application Layer
- Support decision-making processes based on big data analytics
- Monitor and manage the underlying four layers

#### IoT Elements
![[Pasted image 20230508144643.png]]

#### Identification
This is crucial for the IoT name and match services with the demand
- Ex. Electronic product codes (EPC)
- IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses

#### Sensing
This gathers data from related objects and sends it back to a data warehouse, database, or cloud

#### Communication
These include various technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID, NFC, 5G with various systems of protocols

#### Computation
This is the brain's computational ability
- Hardware: Microcontrollers, microprocessors, SoCs, FPGAs, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Gadgeteer
- Operating systems: RTOS such as Contiki, TinyOS, LiteOS
- Cloud Platforms such as the free tier of Google Cloud Platform and AWS (Amazon Cloud Platform)

#### Services
Various applications we already mentioned

#### Semantics
Extract knowledge smartly by different machines to provide the required services
- Discover and use resources, model information
- Recognise and analyse data for decision making
- Represent the brain by sending demands to the right resources

### IoT big data challenge
- Storage - big data needs smart and efficient storage

### IoT Vulnerabilities

#### By Layers:
- Device Based - Vulnerabilities associated with the hardware
- Network Based - Vulnerabilities caused by weakness originated from communication protocol
- Software based - Vulnerabilities related to the firmware and/or the software of IoT
![[Pasted image 20230508150215.png]]

#### Deficient Physical Security
- IoT environments where IoT devices operate automatically are unattended
- Unauthorised physical access
- Cryptographic mechanisms unveiled or disabled 
- Firmware replaced by malicious malware
- Hardware analysis

##### Example: Smart meter ID modification
- Find where the smart meter ID is stored in the external EEPROM, and change the ID to any arbitrary value
- The comprised smart meter can represent itself as ant other smart meter
- Energy theft becomes possible

#### Insufficient energy harvesting
- IoT devices have limited energy and may be unable to renew it automatically.
- Attackers can drain the stored energy by flooding attack, causing DDoS to legitimate users
- Smart phones can run more than 10 hours while web browsing, and rechargeable daily
- An IoT sensor tag capable of reporting information such as presence, temperature, and humidity, must deliver data over a wireless link for at least 10,000 hours on a coin cell battery with less than 1/15 the energy of that in the phone, and NEVER recharged
- Why not harvest energy from the environment – from either manmade or natural sources?
	- Yes, you can, but there are challenges
	- Low-frequency electromagnetic energy base station is useful only for distances a few times the size of the antenna. Remotely IoT nodes/sensors cannot be powered
	- Light harvesting appears to be easier to implement at the scale needed for IoT nodes

#### Energy and Cryptography
- At MCU (microcontroller unit), each 16-bit operation at 12MHz uses approximately 0.7uJ.
- Doubling the MCU’s overhead for security mechanisms for each packet gives a security engineer less than 20, 000 operations, at 16 bit, to ensure confidentiality, privacy and validation.
- However, a lightweight SSL implementation for a low-end device, required roughly 16 million operations! 
- Other factors including memory also make conventional cryptography fail to port to ultra-low-end IoT devices. A typical IoT device might have only 512 bytes of RAM and very limited code space. AES involves 800 bytes of lookup tables!
- Save energy using dedicated cryptographic circuitry, either on chip or in a cryptographic coprocessor. Example: AES encryption on 29-bytes packets consumes 24 uW on cryptographic circuitry, but 10 times the power on a 2- byte ultra-low-power microcontroller

#### Energy and Security Mechanism
The combination of security mechanisms significantly increases energy consumption
