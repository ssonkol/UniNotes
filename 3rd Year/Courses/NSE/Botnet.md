# Botnet
---
## Notes

This is a logical collection of internet-connected devices (computers, smartphones or IoT devices) that have been infected and are controlled by a third party.

The attacker can control the botnet using a command and control (C&C) software where the infected devices become zombies controlled by the owner (attacker) of the botnet.

### How to build a botnet
1. Hacker purchases an exploit kit and uses it to start infecting users' computers
	1. Inside the kit's payload is the malicious application - bot
2. The bot instructs the infected PC to connect to a particular command-and-control server.
	1. This allows the attacker to keep logs of how many bots are active and online
3. The bot master may then use the bots to gather keystrokes and steal online credentials and may rent out the botnet as a service for DDoS or spam emails, or sell the credentials online for a profit
4. Depending on the quality and capability of the bots, the value is increased or decreased
