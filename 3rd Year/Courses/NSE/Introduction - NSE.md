## Notes

### CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality**: Assures that private or confidential information is not disclosed to unauthorised individuals

- **Integrity**: Assures that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorised manner
	- E.g. timetable being changed by member of staff

- **Availability**: Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorised users

Funnily enough they are not equally important... It depends on the situation.
e.g. 
- Current exam paper 
	- Needs high confidentiality and integrity but low availability since people aren't supposed to see it
- Covid-19 Guidance
	- Needs high availability and integrity but we don't really care much about confidentiality since everyone needs to know about it

### Six Points of Security
- **Non-repudiation**: Assures that neither sender nor receiver can deny transmitted message or transaction

- **Authentication**: This assures that an entity is the one they claim to be

- **Code Validation**: Assures that software/firmware codes are sound and checked for vulnerabilities.

(Confidentiality, Availability and Integrity are what makes it 6)
