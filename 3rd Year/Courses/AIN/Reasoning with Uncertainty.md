# Reasoning with Uncertainty

## Definitions

## Notes
The idea of observability can be split into two concepts:

- Full observability
	Example:
	> Chess, Go, Ur
- Partial Observability
	Example:
	>Poker, Starcraft, Fortnite

In the real world we have a partially observable environment... not being able to see a whole building's floor layout by eye etc.

When there is partial observability in an environment then this results in uncertainty

### Uncertainty
We can handle uncertainty by:
- Using probability
- Probabilistic assertions to summarize the effects of:
	- Laziness - Failure to enumerate exceptions, qualifications, etc.
	- Ignorance - Lack of relevant facts, initial conditions, etc.

But even with probabilistic assumptions, there are still issues... Computational complexity, obtaining values, semantics...

You can find more about this on [[Probability Theory]].
