## Definitions
Probability Theory 
> A branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of random phenomena.

Random Variable
>A numerical outcome of a random phenomenon

Naïve Bayes
>It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple terms, a Naïve Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.


## Notes
#### Normalisation
We can use $\alpha = \frac{1}{P(toothache)}$ to normalise
