### Accessible Environments
An environment is **accessible** if the agent can obtain all ==**accurate**== and ==**up-to-date**== information ==**about all the relevant aspects**.==

### Deterministic & Stochastic Environments

A **deterministic** environment is one in which any action has a ==**single guaranteed effect**== - hence no uncertainty about the state that will be activated after performing an action.

An environment where we can ==**quantify the non-determinism**== with probability is called ==**stochastic**==.

### Episodic & Sequential Environments
In an **episodic** environment, performance of an agent is dependent on a number of discrete episodes, with ==**no link between the performance of an agent in different episodes.**==

In a **non-episodic** or sequential environment, the ==**current decision affects future decisions**==

### Dynamic vs Static Environments
A **dynamic** environment has ==**other processes operating on or in it**==, and hence may change in ways beyond the agent's control.

A **static** environment remains ==**unchanged except by the performance of the agent's own actions**==.

### Discrete vs Continuous Environments
We should ask ourselves, does the agent's environment have a fixed, finite number of actions and percepts in it?

- If yes, then it is **discrete**
- Otherwise it is **continuous**
