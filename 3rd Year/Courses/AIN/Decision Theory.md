## Notes

When we have a list of probabilities based on different methods it becomes hard to choose a desirable outcome based on preference.

Say if you want to get to the airport on time and eat some lunch before getting on the plane; well that has a different probability to getting to the airport on time and wanting to just get on the plane straight away.

To handle these uncertainties, we use:
- Utility theory - This represents and infers preferences
- [[Decision Theory]] - This is the utility theory + probability theory
