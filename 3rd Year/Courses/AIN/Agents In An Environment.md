# Agents In An Environment

When we see an agent acting in an environment, it generates what is called a **run**.

A run is a sequence of interleaved states and actions.

Example:
>s0, a1, s1, a2, s2, a3, s3,...

Given the example image below, an agent would work out potential ways to go around an object.

But with a non-deterministic or dynamic environment, the set of possible runs is more complex.
