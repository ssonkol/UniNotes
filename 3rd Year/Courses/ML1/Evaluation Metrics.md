# Evaluation Metrics

## Notes

### Evaluating clusters
**External Evaluation** is how well the number of clusters serves a downstream task

**Internal Evaluation** tries to establish how coherent the clusters are and how well they are separated from each other.

#### Davis-Bouldin Index.
The DB index will be small when clusters are tightly grouped and far from each other .
