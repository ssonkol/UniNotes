# Classification vs Regression
--- 

## Notes

### Classification
Classification is used on data with a categorical value (i.e. names)

#### Probabilistic Prediction
Learning tries to estimate the probability a certain object/value is within the set of categories based on its features.

So it would be the probability of being in each class, given the input and the set of training data.
We can choose the class by choosing the one with the highest probability given the input. 


### Regression
Regression is used on a real-valued scalar
- You may also have ordinal regression i.e. grades A-F

#### Linear Regression
This type of regression assumes that the output y is a linear combination of the input x.
- Learning is the process of figuring out what the weight should be to give a good mapping.
