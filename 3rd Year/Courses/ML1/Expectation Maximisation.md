# Expectation Maximisation

## Notes
Expectation Maximization (EM) is an iterative algorithm used to estimate parameters of a probabilistic model when we have incomplete data. Here's a simplified explanation of how EM works:

1. Start with an initial guess for the parameters of the model, denoted as h = <μ1, μ2> (in this case, we assume a model with two Gaussian distributions with means μ1 and μ2).
2. E-step (Expectation step): For each data point $x_i$, calculate the expected value E$z_{ij}$ of the hidden variable $z_{ij}$, which represents the probability that $x_i$ was generated by the jth Gaussian distribution. This is done using the current hypothesis h = <μ1, μ2> and the observed data xi.
3. M-step (Maximization step): Update the parameters of the model (in this case, the means μ1 and μ2) using the calculated expected values E[zij]. The update is done to maximize the likelihood of the observed data given the current hypothesis h = <μ1, μ2>.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, which is achieved when the change in parameters becomes very small.
5. The final parameters of the model after convergence, denoted as h' = <μ'1, μ'2>, are the estimated maximum likelihood hypothesis.

In simple terms, EM algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameters, then iteratively estimates the hidden variables based on the current guess and updates the parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This process continues until convergence, and the final parameters are the estimated maximum likelihood hypothesis.

EM can be applied to various situations where we want to estimate parameters of a distribution using incomplete data. It uses the E-step to estimate the hidden variables and the M-step to update the parameters. EM converges to a local maximum of the likelihood function, and the global maximum is achieved when the likelihood function has a single maximum.

Random restart or careful selection of starting points can be used to overcome the issue of local maximum.
