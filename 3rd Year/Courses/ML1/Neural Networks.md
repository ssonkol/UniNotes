## Notes

An Artificial Neural Network is a mathematical function that can produce approximations of real values, discrete values or vectors of values.

It is built out of a densely interconnected set of units where each unit takes a number of real-valued inputs and produces a single real-valued output.


Artificial Neural Networks are made up of nodes which have:
- Input weights
	- Weights can be positive or negative and may change over time when learning.
- Output edges (with weights)
- Activation Level
	- This is a non-linear transfer function (g) of the input ![[Pasted image 20230303185043.png]]

The input function is the weighted sum of the activation levels of inputs
