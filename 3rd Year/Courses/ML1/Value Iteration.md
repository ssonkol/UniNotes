# Value Iteration

## Notes

1. Assign an arbitrary utility U_0(s) to every state
2. For every state, carry out the following update:![[Pasted image 20230308132004.png]]
3. Continue updating until the utilities of states do not change

After an infinate number of applications, the utilities are guaranteed to converge on the optimal values
