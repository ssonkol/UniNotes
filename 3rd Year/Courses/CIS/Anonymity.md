# Anonymity

## Notes

##### Definitions

**Anonymity** - The state of being not identifiable within a set of subjects [1]

##### Ideas

All actions are observable the goal of anonymity is to make actions(sending, receiving or communicating) undistinguishable from everybody else's in a group. The larger the group the better.

Remember!! You cannot be anonymous by yourself

Types of Attacks on Anonymity
>- Passive traffic analysis:
>	- Infer from network traffic who is talking with who
>	
>- Active traffic analysis:
>	- Inject packets or put a timing signature on packet flow
>	
>- Compromise of network nodes (routers):

So we try to unlink action and identity in a network and preferably the ability to prevent an observer from telling whether a certain action took place or not
