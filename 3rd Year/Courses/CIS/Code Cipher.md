# Code Cipher

## Notes
Codes work on words of varying length

The translation is given by a code-book

A string of symbols stands for a complete message

Example:
> Example: “OCELOT" is ciphertext for “TURN LEFT 90 DEGREES" and “LOLLIPOP" is ciphertext for “TURN RIGHT 90 DEGREES"

#### Issues:
- If there is no entry for a word then you won't be able to say it
- Security is pushed to the code-book, which needs to be protected
