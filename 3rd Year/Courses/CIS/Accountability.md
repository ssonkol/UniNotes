# Accountability

##### Definitions
- **Accountability** - When actions can be traced to responsible principals

##### Notes
Actions are recorded and can be traced to the party responsible

If prevention methods and access controls fail then we can use an 'Audit trail' to detect the responsible party

A problem may arise when keeping machine log trails. If a system is compromised, the logs can also be tampered with...
Therefore we can send log messages to an append-only file, to a separate server or even a physically isolated printer.

A stronger form of this is *[[Non-Repudiation]]*.

Examples:
> An audit trail is tampered with, lost, or cannot establish where a security breach occurred.
