This is a more formal way of planning using a <P,A,I,G> tuple where:

- P is a finite set of propositions

- A is a set of actions of which has:
	- A precondition - A set of propositions that must be true in order for A to be executed
	- Add effects - A set of propositions added that become true upon execution of A
	- Delete effects: A set of propositions that are deleted upon execution of A

- I is a finite set of propositions representing the initial state

- G is the goal where there are a set of propositions that must be true for a state to be considered as a goal state.
