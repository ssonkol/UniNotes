# Heuristic Search
#### Heuristic Search
This is a function that takes a state and returns an estimate of its distance from the goal

*Note: Heuristics are usually not perfect or there may be no search...

- priority = smallest h(s) = ignore plan so far
or
- priority = f(S) = g(S) + h(S)

- Intuition - distance so far + distance to goal estimates the eventual distance for that option
